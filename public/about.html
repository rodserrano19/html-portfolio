<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Rodyard Van Serrano, an aspiring Web Developer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a Warehouseman, managing daily operations and ensuring everything runs smoothly. In my free time, I dedicate myself to studying Web Development, steadily building the skills I need to transition into the tech industry.</p>

<p>Aside from web development, I have a creative sideâ€”I'm into video editing and image editing, where I get to express my artistic flair and attention to detail. I also enjoy playing DOTA 2, which challenges my strategic thinking and keeps me sharp.</p>

<p>With a strong passion for growth, I'm committed to becoming a skilled developer who can work from home and achieve my goal of earning a six-digit income. I bring the same dedication and focus that I apply in my current job to every new challenge I face in learning and development. Each day is a step closer to fulfilling my dreams, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead.</p>
